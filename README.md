# Vulkan Renderer

This is my implementation of a Vulkan Renderer. It's all in a monolithic structure for learning purposes. I'm working on
an object-oriented version on the [oo-abstraction]() branch.

# Todo:

* [Object-Oriented Abstraction]()
* Mipmap Generation
* Multisampling

# Example Models & Textures:

All the used models and textures aren't created by me. You can find the source and creator with the following links.
